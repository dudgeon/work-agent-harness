[] create meta/onboarding: create sylabus of the basic parts of the harness; checklist when each component has been demonstrated, plus reference ti where/how it was demonstrated ince complete; instructions to coding agent (skill?) for initial ftux
[] handling for tasks that are large/conplex, have associated file or folder for completion; maybe distinction between todo/task/project?
