# Tasks

Cross-domain task tracker. Check this at session start.

Tasks may also appear in domain-specific files for local context, but this file is the authoritative cross-domain view.

---

## Active

- [ ] Personalize the harness: create initial context files (company-info.md, stakeholder-map.md, etc.) from real content
- [ ] Test inbox → triage → domain flow with real inbox items
- [ ] Validate cross-agent sync: test AGENTS.md changes propagate to Windsurf and Claude mirrors
- [ ] Create first domain from actual work content (don't pre-seed)

## Backlog

- [ ] Evaluate publishing/syncing pipeline options (GitHub Actions vs manual review)
- [ ] Determine metadata-based vs path-based filtering for shareable content
- [ ] Consider competitive-analysis template (referenced in README but not yet created)
- [ ] Test Windsurf skill auto-invocation with `.windsurf/skills/` files

## Completed

_None yet — this is a fresh harness._
